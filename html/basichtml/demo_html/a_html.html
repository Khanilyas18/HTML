The layout of the Red Fort was organised to keep and integrate this site with the Salimgarh Fort. The planning and aesthetics of the Red Fort represent the high point in Mughal creativity which happened during the reign of Emperor Shah Jahan. This Fort has had many additions after its construction by Emperor Shah Jahan. It is a World Heritage Site.[2] it is made out of red sandstone. </span> <hr> </li>

<h1 align="center" style="color: brown;"> TAJ MAHAL</h1><hr>
        <li> <span style="color: chocolate;"> The Taj Mahal is an Islamic religious building, mosque and tomb in India. It was built in the 17th century by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.[3]

The building is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh. It is widely thought as one of the most beautiful buildings in the world. It is one of India's biggest tourist attractions.

The Taj Mahal is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
 together with the Agra Fort, 2.5 kilometers away. It was listed as one of the 7 Wonders of the World in 2007. It is on the south bank of the Yamuna river in Agra.

The building was originally white. Because of pollution, it is turning yellow. Sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere reacts with water molecules and becomes sulphuric acid, which slowly destroys the outer layer of the building.
 The building also appears to be pink in the morning, yellow-ish in the evening, and gold at night.</span><hr> </li>
