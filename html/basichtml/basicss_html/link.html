    <h1>IPL </h1>
    <p>
        The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India organised by the Board of
        Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007, the league features ten state-based or city-based
        franchise teams.[2] The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and is held between
        March and May. It has an exclusive window in the Future Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council
        (ICC), resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[3] It is also the most
        viewed sports competition in India, as per the Broadcast Audience Research Council.[4][5]

        In 2014, it ranked sixth in attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting
        event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues
        have been established.[a][11][12] IPL is the second-richest sports league in the world by per-match value, after
        the NFL. In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next 4 seasons for US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and
        Star Sports,[13] which meant that each IPL match was valued at $13.4 million.[14] As of 2024, there have been
        seventeen seasons of the tournament. The current champions are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who won the 2024
        season after defeating the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the final.[15] In just six years, the IPL's value has more
        than doubled, reaching $12 billion in 2024.[16]
